Bidirectional Telegram integration for [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip). Push agent notifications to Telegram, receive bot commands, approve requests with inline buttons, gather community signals, run multi-agent sessions in threads, process media attachments, register custom commands, and deploy proactive agent suggestions.

Built on the Paperclip plugin SDK and the domain event bridge ([PR #909](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/909)).

## Why this exists

Multiple Paperclip users asked for notifications on the same day the plugin system shipped (2026-03-14):

> "is there a way to have codex/claude check paperclip to see when tasks are done without me prompting it?" - @Choose Liberty, Discord #dev

> "basically to have it 'let me know when its done'" - @Choose Liberty, Discord #dev

> "can claude code check paperclip to see when tasks are done" - @Nascozz, Discord #dev

@dotta (maintainer) responded: "we're also adding issue-changed hooks for plugins so when that lands someone could [make notifications]." The event bridge ([PR #909](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip/pull/909)) shipped that same day. @Ryze said "Really excited by the plugins. I had developed a custom plugin bridge that I will now deprecate and migrate over to the new supported plugin system."

This is that plugin.

## What it does

### Notifications (MarkdownV2 with plain text fallback)

- **Issue created** - Title, description, status, priority, assignee, project fields, and a "View Issue" link
- **Issue done** - Completion confirmation with status fields
- **Approval requested** - Interactive **Approve** and **Reject** inline buttons. Click to act without leaving Telegram.
- **Agent error** - Error message with warning indicator
- **Agent run started/finished** - Lifecycle notifications

### Interactive approvals
- Approve/reject inline buttons on every approval notification
- Clicking a button calls the Paperclip API and updates the Telegram message inline
- Callback query acknowledgment with result text

### Per-type chat routing
- `approvalsChatId` - Dedicated chat for approval notifications
- `errorsChatId` - Dedicated chat for agent errors
- `escalationChatId` - Dedicated chat for agent escalations
- Falls back to `defaultChatId` when per-type chats aren't configured
- Per-company overrides via `/connect`

### Bot commands
- `/status` - Show active agents and recent completions
- `/issues` - List open issues
- `/agents` - List agents with status indicators
- `/approve <id>` - Approve a pending approval
- `/help` - Display all available commands
- `/connect <company>` - Link this chat to a Paperclip company
- `/connect_topic <project-name> <topic-id>` - Map a forum topic to a Paperclip project
- `/acp spawn <agent>` - Start a new agent session in the current thread
- `/acp status` - Check ACP session status
- `/acp cancel` - Cancel a running ACP session
- `/acp close` - Close a completed ACP session
- `/commands import <json>` - Import a workflow command
- `/commands list` - List registered workflow commands
- `/commands run <name> [args]` - Execute a workflow command
- `/commands delete <name>` - Delete a workflow command

### Phase 1: HITL Escalation
- Agents call `escalate_to_human` tool when stuck (low confidence, user request, policy violation, unknown intent)
- Escalation posted to dedicated channel with conversation context, suggested reply, and confidence score
- Inline buttons: Send Suggested Reply, Reply, Override, Dismiss
- Configurable timeout with default actions (`defer`, `auto_reply`, `close`)
- Hold message sent to customer while waiting for human response
- Reply routing back to originating chat via native or ACP transport

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Group Threads
- Multiple agents per thread (up to 5 configurable via `maxAgentsPerThread`)
- `@mention` routing: address a specific agent by name in a multi-agent thread
- Reply-to routing: reply to an agent's message to route to that agent
- Fallback routing: most recently active agent receives unaddressed messages
- **Handoff**: agents call `handoff_to_agent` tool to transfer work, with optional human approval gate
- **Discuss**: agents call `discuss_with_agent` tool to start back-and-forth conversation loops
- Conversation loops with configurable max turns and human checkpoint pauses
- Stale loop detection (auto-pause when output repeats)
- Output sequencing so multi-agent responses don't interleave
- Native-first spawning: tries Paperclip agent sessions before falling back to ACP
- Auto-spawn on handoff/discuss if target agent isn't already in the thread

### Phase 3: Media-to-Task Pipeline
- Voice messages, audio, video notes, documents, and photos routed to agents
- Voice/audio transcription via Whisper API with transcription preview posted back
- **Brief Agent**: media sent to intake channels is forwarded to a configurable Brief Agent for triage
- Media in active agent threads is routed to the active session (native or ACP)

### Phase 4: Custom Workflow Commands
- `/commands import <json>` - import a multi-step workflow as a custom slash command
- `/commands list` - show all registered custom commands
- `/commands run <name> [args]` - execute a workflow
- `/commands delete <name>` - remove a custom command
- Custom commands invocable directly as `/<name>` (cannot override built-ins)
- **Workflow step types**: `fetch_issue`, `invoke_agent`, `http_request`, `send_message`, `create_issue`, `wait_approval`, `set_state`
- Template interpolation: `{{arg0}}`, `{{args}}`, `{{prev.result}}`, `{{step_id.result}}`
- Per-company command registry

### Phase 5: Proactive Agent Suggestions
- Agents call `register_watch` tool to set up condition-based monitors
- Watch conditions: `gt`, `lt`, `eq`, `ne`, `contains`, `exists` operators on entity fields
- Watches evaluate against issues, agents, or custom state-stored data
- Built-in templates: `invoice-overdue`, `lead-stale`
- Custom templates with `{{field}}` placeholder interpolation
- Rate limiting: configurable max suggestions per hour per company
- Deduplication: same watch+entity won't re-fire within a configurable window (default 24h)
- Scheduled job checks all watches periodically

### Reply routing
- Reply to any bot notification to route your message back to Paperclip
- Replies to issue notifications create issue comments automatically
- Replies to escalation notifications resolve the escalation as a human reply
- Enable/disable with `enableInbound` config toggle (default: true)

### Daily digest
- Configurable digest summaries posted to your Telegram chats
- Modes: `daily` (once), `bidaily` (twice), `tridaily` (three times per day)
- Configure via the `digestMode` config setting
- Includes: tasks completed/created, active agents, in-progress/review/blocked issues

### Forum topic routing
- Map Telegram forum topics to Paperclip projects via `/connect_topic`
- Notifications for a project are routed to its mapped topic
- Requires a group with forum topics enabled

## Install

```bash
npm install paperclip-plugin-telegram
```

Or register with your Paperclip instance directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3100/api/plugins/install \

3. Save the bot token
4. Send a message to your bot, then run `curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates"` and find the `chat.id` field
5. In Paperclip, go to **Settings -> Secrets -> Create new secret**, paste your bot token as the secret value, and copy the resulting UUID

## Migration

### v0.2.1

The `telegramBotTokenRef` and `transcriptionApiKeyRef` fields now require a Paperclip secret reference (a UUID), not the raw token value. If you previously entered your raw bot token in the field, follow these steps to migrate:

1. Go to **Settings -> Secrets -> Create new secret**
2. Paste your Telegram bot token as the secret value and save
3. Copy the resulting UUID
4. Open **Plugin Settings for Telegram Bot** and paste the UUID into "Telegram Bot Token"
5. Save and restart the plugin

The plugin will fail to activate if a raw token (non-UUID) is entered in the field.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

~80 tests covering notifications, approvals, escalation, session registry, media pipeline, custom commands, proactive suggestions, MarkdownV2 formatting, and bot commands.
